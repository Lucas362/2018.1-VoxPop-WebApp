# How to contribute

We love your contribution! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

* Reporting a bug;
* Discussing the current state of the code;
* Submitting a fix;
* Proposing new features;
* Becoming a maintainer.

## **Pull Requests**

We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through Pull Requests.

GitHub Flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly. Basically, GitHub Flow works this way:

1. Create a branch from `master`;
2. Add commits with your changes;
3. Open a Pull Request;
4. Discuss and review your code;
5. Deploy;
6. Merge.

P.S.: Remember increase the version numbers in any required files and in the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## **Feature requests**

If you wish to propose a feature, please submit an issue. Try to explain your use case as fully as possible to help us understand why you think the feature should be added.

## **Bug reports**

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest `master` in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; a good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS
experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.
